# GTA - Group of Teleinformation and Automation

GTA is a laboratory of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) that researches about network and how to improve it to the future.

## Network Researcher Intern (Jan/2010 - Dec/2010)

My job was to research about network virtualization with OpenFlow and develop a platform to manage the virtual networks.

The main feature was to make the network manager able to migrate a specific flow from a network path to another without package loss. This feature was provided by a web interface, where the network manager could search by the flow, visualize it on network topology and do the flow migration just with an drag and drop.
