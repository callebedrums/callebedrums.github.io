# General Electric

General Electric is a multinational company present in different markets, and always a big player when present.

I stemp all my GE carrear in the GE Healthcare business, where GE is really strong in the medical image business, providing different machines, modalities, and healthcare solutions.

## GE Healthcare

### Staff Software Engineer (Nov/2019 - Apr/2023)

Location: Chicago, IL, USA

As a Staff Software Engineer at GE Healthcare I was involved in multiple projects.

The last project I was involved with was an internal solution to automate and accelerate the deployment of GE products to its customers. The project was composed by different applications and services, including: a Frontend application developed with Angular and deployed in an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket; a backend API implemented with nodejs and deployed as [AWS Lambda Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/#:~:text=AWS%20Lambda%20is%20a%20serverless,pay%20for%20what%20you%20use.); an [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) container registry implemented with [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to store customer's solution configuration; an [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) to expose the backend api and handle authorization; an [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) configuration to instantiate the AWS Resources and infrastructure. I did the application integration with the GE Healthcare Identity Provider service to enable authentication and authorization. I also performed the initial CloudFormation configuration to instanciate all the required resources. I did the initial integration between the backend service and the OCI registry, and the initial backend API implementation. I was always working close to other team members and architects, helping with the technical decisions, and define the solutions to attend the requisits.

Besides the project described above, I was always working as a Frontend Engineer, involved in the development of the Frontend Applications.
In its majority, GE Healthcare Frontend Applications use Angular framework. On the addoption of the Angular framework I designed, planned, and exceuted a framework migration from AngularJs 1.x to the latest version of Angular on that time. The designed for this migration included the addoption of a Hybrid solution where both frameworks, Angular and AngularJS, would co-exist in the same projects, and, with the progress of the project, old AngularJS components would be migrated to new Angular components. This approach allowed a migration process that didn't prevent the implementation of new features, and didn't disrupt the project development.

In one of the Projects, I helped to design and implement a microfrontend architecture for the Frontend Application. As part of this work, I set up all the Frontend applications repositories, the common libraries repositories, their build pipeline, unit tests and component tests, and established the comunication standard among the micro-applications. I also created templates that could be easly spinned of into new applications ready to be integrated in this microfrontend solution.

I have developed proof of concepts of the [SMART on FHIR](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/) Authentication and Authorization Service, based on [OAuth2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and [OIDC](https://openid.net/) protocols, and of a [FHIRcast](https://fhircast.org/) hub. The proof of concepts helped to bring clarity and understanding on how these protocols work, how to implement them, and how to addopt and use them to better integrate the many solutions GE Healthcare develops.

Many projects were cloude based, and used Kubernetis as their Cloud orchestrator, witch gave me a good knowledge base with Docker, K8s, K8S resources and helm charts.

As a Staff Frontend Engineer I was constantly guiding and helping new team members to ramp up and learn the projects, providing feedback, code review, and helping them to learn and improve in their technical skills

### Senior Software Engineer (Sep/2017 - Nov/2019)

Location: San Ramon, CA, USA

As a Senior Software Engineer at GE Healthcare I was involved mostly in developing Frontend applications to the Health Cloud platform.

Case Exchange was one of the solutions developed to the Health Cloud platform, where, clinicians can create Study Cases and share this cases with other clinicians and have a multidisciplinary analysis of the patient.

Focused on the Case Exchange project I was always involved with Product Iteration Planning; Sprint Planning; identifying and managing internal dependencies; identifying and mitigating risks; grooming Features and User Stories with Product Owners and Architects; defining Acceptance Criteria for Features and User Stories; benchmarking new Technologies and developing Proof of Concepts; implementing new Features and User Stories; performing tests and automating tests; writing Unit Tests and Behavior Tests; Leading and guiding new Engineers; defining best practices for the project; perform code reviews, and many other tasks;

I planned and prepared Case Exchange project to have the AngularJs 1.x framework migrated to Angular, migration that was performed by the team following the plan and preparation after I left the project.

## GE GRC - Global Research Center

### Software Engineer (Jun/2015 - Sep/2017)

Location: Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil

As a Software Engineer at GE Global Research Center, I mostly worked in projects and partneships with GE Healthcare business, helping to develop the Patient History application for the Health Cloud platform, and a Warehouse management system for one of the GE local Warehouse in brasil.

Joining GE GRC, I shifted my career from a Full Stack engineer to be a Frontend focused Engineer. Having a Full Stack background before, helped me to be a better Frontend Engineer, understanding the entire solution, and how to better develop the Frontend part of it in a performing, secure and user friendly way.
