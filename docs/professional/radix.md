# Radix Engineering and Software

Radix Engineering and Software is a consulting company that provides Engineering and Software solutions for different business and customers.

## Software Engineer (Jun/2011 - May/2015)

Location: Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil

As a Software Engineer I was most of the time involved in projects to Rede Globo, which is the Brazilina's biggets Televigion broadcasting company and one of the Radix's most important client.

Many of the projects for Rede Globo involved projects to manage their resources, their productions, resource allocations to the productions, engineering schematics for Journalism, and many others. Most of the projects were Web Applications projects, but some involved mobile applications targeting iOS devices.

MVC architecture was the main architecture for the frontend applications, while WCF was the protocol used for the services.

At Radix, I slowly became a Frontend reference, helping to solve frontend performance issues, and help to better structure and organize the frontend development.
